7. Rock Paper Scissors game
   * challenging each other on an app
   * use websocket
   * keep track of score
   * multiplayer, when someone gets out another person has to step up

9. Just Dance - Tracks if you did it, increase speed number of steps 
10. Tamagotchi/online pet
   * Web or phone app
11. Use tensorflow to track movement in the air to paint
   * Tensorflow, web
   * once a day you're asked to paint something, and that is sent to your group of friends. Each friend has to vote on what they think you drew, and you get points depending on 

# Team Norms

### Expectations
* Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
* If a group member plans on working off hours, or feels inspired, they'll send a quick heads up so everyone is on the same page
* We expect that no one will merge the main branch until we have had a code review, or we have discussed the newly added functionality (this will happen once a day)
* Anytime we get frustrated, be it our own code or during a discussion in a tense decision making stage, we take a 5 min breather then regroup
* Come to stand-up with root cause of any issues or bugs we've run into, with a quick what happened, where, why and how to avoid going forward
* If you're taking a break during working hours, you send a message to the slack channel to let us know you'll be unavailable
* We'll keep the paired programming sessions fluid and open to personal interpretation. People switch when they feel like they've reached a good stopping point

### Disagreements
Steps to reach an agreement: 
1. Everyone says their piece about what direction they believe we should go, we have a conversation to start to see if we can get on the same page
2. If no agreement can be reached, or we're at a stalemate, then it goes up to a vote. We explain why we voted that way and why we feel strongly about it so hopefully no one feels hurt or left out of the decision
3. If residual feelings or thoughts exist and we still can't reach an agreement, we'll escalate to our mentor/instructor
