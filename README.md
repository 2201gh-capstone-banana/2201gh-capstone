# <p align="center"> Be My Voice </p>

## Intro & Goal
The problem: Approximately 250,000-500,000 Americans (and some Canadians) use American Sign Language, yet we at Be My Voice believe that number should be higher. Our goal is to make American Sign Language accessible to those who have not yet been exposed to this language and to use these translations to increase knowledge and understanding of ASL. 

Be My Voice is a translation web app that uses machine learning models to translate American sign language.

## Who is it for?
The web app is for people who want to translate basic ASL phrases or are interested in learning more about ASL.

## User Story:

Kate lives a block away from Gallaudet University in Washington, DC and wants to be a better neighbor. She hears about the app through her friend Kelsey and signs up to access the translation portion of Be My Voice. She learns that her deaf neighbor has been saying good morning to her everyday when they walk their dogs around the neighborhood, and she is now able to say it back.

Michael has been watching a TV show that includes characters who exclusively use sign language in the show. Although he has captions, he wants to learn more about some of the signs he sees depicted on TV. This helps grow his understanding and interest in learning more about ASL.
